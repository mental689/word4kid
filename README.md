Word4Kid
=====
A small word game app for kid using Django. The purpose is to help kids learn English by completing some sentences with given words.

### How to play?

* In this simple game, kids will watch a short video (less than 3 minutes or **3MT** as we call).

* After watching a **3MT**, kids will be asked to see a list of events that happened in the 3MT.
These event labels are collected by our very hard-working workers and will be given to kids for free.

* Each label is linked to its definition in [Kids.WordsMyth.net](https://kids.wordsmyth.net).

* So the question kids need to answer is to **provide a sentence with only the given words to best describe the whole 3MT**.
